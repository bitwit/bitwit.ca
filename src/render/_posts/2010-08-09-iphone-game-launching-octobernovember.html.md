I continue to work away on my iPhone game which I hope to release this fall. So far my design team has been an amazing help and testers have provided some great feedback to shape this game.  The game is already beyond my expectations and there's still so much to do.

Always looking for new testers, email me if interested.

I've begun adding some of my portfolio of  web development work this year, more to come.
