Since I was a kid I always had some fascination with electronics. I never got much further than the most basics of circuits but it's been in the back of my mind to try again for quite a while.

With the hardware and internet of things movement getting well underway, I felt it was about time I got more familiar with modern circuitry tools. Being a software developer, it also fascinated me to start bridging my knowledge from the other side and understanding the origins of computers.

### Figuring out where to start

It was hard for me to figure out where to start at first. A few years ago I got my first Raspberry Pi, but quickly concluded it wasn't really low level enough to do what I wanted, and the motivation died for a while. After attending a talk about getting starting with hardware, I learned the Arduino Microcontroller was a much more suitable fit for hardware prototyping. That was good to know, but other than an awareness of the Arduino and its ability to work with various sensors, I still had no concept of what constitues even the most basic circuit. Then I finally found the perfect motivator...

### Tron Club

About 3 months ago, I learned of a new subscription startup, called [Tron Club][1], that would ship about $20 of circuitry parts and a booklet every month. With that, I had my perfect motivator. All the hassle of buying parts and creating a lesson plan taken out of my hands.

After 2 kits worth of lessons, how has it been going so far? Really well, I think. The kits have been extremely useful in providing a wide bredth of pieces to tickle one's curiousity. I didn't find all the instructions as thorough as I might have liked at times, but all the answers to my questions have been only a Youtube search away. Tron Club gave me all the right kind of terminology I needed to query the internet effectively.

So what has some of my progress looked like? Well here are a few Vines I captured over the last few months of my progress:

##### Day One

A simple LED light circuit with a photo resistor

##### Day Three

A NAND logic gate that I looked up on Youtube after finishing the first booklet

##### Day 39
After the second kit arrived and I completed most circuits, I challenged myself to make an LED that would blink then go solid from everything I knew so far.

##### Day 60
Combining everything I learned from Tron Club, with my knowledge of C and the Arduino to make a Traffic Light Halloween costume

### It just keeps getting better

Since developing a decent foundation in circuitry, my fascination with the subject matter has only increased. I find myself hanging out on [/r/electronics][2] every day trying to passively learn from others experiences. I can look at circuit board and actually identify a lot of the peices and how they are connecting. Everything that uses power in my house just seems a little less mysterious now, and that's __very empowering__.

It's been 2 very fun months of learning so far and I don't see myself stopping this hobby any time soon. Right now I'm fascinated by voltage dividers and their applications. What's a voltage divider, you ask? I'm working on it and I'm sure I'll be able to tell you all about them soon enough!
