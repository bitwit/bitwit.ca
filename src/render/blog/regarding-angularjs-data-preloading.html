A few weeks ago Gabriel Scholz <a title="Frictionless data preloading in AngularJS" href="http://www.garbl.es/angularjs/preload/2014/06/07/frictionless-data-preloading-in-angularjs/" target="_blank">wrote a blog about frictionless data preloading in AngularJS</a> which I quite enjoyed. He also updated the blog later conceding that there was an even better method. From my experience, neither options were ideal and I wanted to write a short entry on how I propose we preload data in AngularJS.
<h3>A few objectives</h3>
I think that there are a few key attributes that a good solution has to have:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
	<li>It shouldn't pollute the global name space</li>
	<li>It shouldn't require declaration within the scope of `ng-app` in the DOM</li>
	<li>You should be able declare multiple pieces of data separately and concatenate them</li>
	<li>Preloaded data should be optional, not a dependency</li>
</ol>
<h3>The two previously suggested solutions</h3>
1. Gabriel suggested that we put JSON objects inside of &lt;script&gt; tags, identify them by a type such as "text/preloaded" and then parse and add them to a `preloaded` config object via a directive that looks for `script` tags. I actually really like this idea but it didn't satisfy rule #2. Your script tag needed to be inside of `ng-app`'s scope.

2. The blog entry was updated with a solution of simply declaring another module within `script` tags. However, this solution doesn't satisfy rules #3 and #4 very well. I would hate to be declaring and depending on multiple modules of preloaded data.
<h3>My proposed solution</h3>
I actually really like Gabriel's method, except for running the search for preloaded data inside of a directive. Instead I say it should be done inside of a `.run()`, which occurs after `.config()` and before `.controller()`. Like so:

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/bitwit/b8d1a4fa4806d9acefc4.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/bitwit/7763fd56aaebb437a3d5.js"></script>

This method satisfies all 4 rules I stated above. I would love to hear feedback if anyone has a better method.
