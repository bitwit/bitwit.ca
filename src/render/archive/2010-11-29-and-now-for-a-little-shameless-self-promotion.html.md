I suppose I shouldn't have to concern myself with shame when promoting on my own website, but I think I've just been doing so much plugging of my iPhone game lately that it's been accumulating.

Nonetheless, check out my **[Website for Pixel Fighters](http://www.pixelfightersgame.com)**

Last time I posted I said that the game would be out last week. I'm a liar. However, expectations continue to be exceeded and the product I was pumped about 1.5 months ago is nothing close to where it is today.  Testing has been tremendously successful and lead to a level of refinement I could never accomplish otherwise.  Thanks to everyone past, present and future who has/will participate in making Pixel Fighters what it is.

p.s. the website will have a gameplay video soon, it surprisingly more complicated to do right than I expected.
