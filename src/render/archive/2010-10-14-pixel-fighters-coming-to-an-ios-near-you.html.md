I'm very excited to (hopefully) be launching my iPhone/Pad/Pod game at the end of November.  The last serious wave of testing will start this weekend, and all are invited to participate a criticize.  Barring any unforeseen issues and approval from Apple, expect the app to be available the week of November 22nd.

Recruiting my biggest wave of testers yet this month, all are invited, just contact me. Check out the [Testing Section](http://www.bitwit.ca/testing/testing-introduction/) for more info
