Looks like 2012 is going to be a big iOS year for me. Here's why:



### A spiffy new job


I'm very proud to announce that I recently started a new position with [Transcontinental Interactive](http://www.transcontinental-interactive.com/home.aspx) as an iOS Developer. This is a huge landmark for me, as it has been a goal of mine to be a mobile developer at an agency for quite some time. If you read my blog entry ["Aren't You Glad You Learned iOS?"](http://www.bitwit.ca/blog/arent-you-glad-you-learned-ios/) several months ago, you know that iOS pioneered my career change over the last 2.5 years and this is another landmark in that accomplishment.  I'm really excited to improve/develop apps for some big name brands from Canada/North America this year. The experience will be fantastic.

Speaking of which, my past iOS experience/blog content has been almost exclusively related to game development.  Other than some prototyping, I haven't actually developed anything with UIKit, despite being well familiar. I look forward to gaining a more in depth knowledge about UIKit App development and hopefully sharing some tips.



### An iOS marketing goal


Since I first got involved in the iOS App Store, it has been my goal to develop an strong understanding of the marketplace. 
In the past year, I've done a decent job of being as transparent as possible about my personal experiences, sales and goals, but I can't speak much for the market as a whole. This year I want to continue working at this goal but expand in a way that allows me to help share a greater wealth of information about the market as a whole. I'll talk more about this at a later date.



### A RPG game(system) in the pipes


While I'm not confident that I will be releasing a new full game by the end of the year, I will be working away at building a strong/flexible RPG foundation for another iOS game in the future. I've thought a lot about other genres, but they just aren't my thing. Creating Pixel Fighters not only challenged me as a developer, it challenged me as an RPG lover. We, as RPG enthusiasts, have a real fixation on our systems, their intricacies and the strategies/statistics that make our characters the strongest they can be.  One area that I think I failed with Pixel Fighters was creating a system deep enough to generate that kind of energy from its fan base, including myself. I also have a lot of personal gripes about the system's flexibility. So the focus this year will be on getting a good system and prototyping ideas. A strong enough system should be able to play to many RPG game ideas. While I don't expect to give away everything I'm doing, I expect to be sharing more details on the core of Pixel Fighters, its weaknesses and the direction I'm going next.



### More iOS blogging to come


So with that, I'll keep this entry short. Expect more blogging this year related to the topics above; that's my direction this year
