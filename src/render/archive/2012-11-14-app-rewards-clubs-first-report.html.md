This morning Ken and I [released our first report on the App Rewards Club blog](http://blog.apprewardsclub.com/going-free-our-launch-results-and-market-observations/). Inside, we've shared aggregate results for 12 apps that switched from paid to free as well as some analysis on Free App A Day. In addition, there's also other news about our business so far.

I hope you enjoy the read and find it insightful. We'll be doing more of this in the future.
