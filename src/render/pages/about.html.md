BitWit Solutions Canada is a Software Consulting company run by myself, Kyle Newsome. Since 2009, I have been consulting with teams to provide technical solutions that are both sensitive to business needs and pragmatic in technical implementation.

I provide expertise in the areas of Web and Mobile Development, Project Management, User Interaction Design, Continuous Delivery and Developer Training.
