We focus on maintaining strong and current knowledge on all Apple platform capabilities and guidelines

We help companies with few or no mobile engineers develop their first products for Apple platforms

## 💻 ‍Why work with us?

When putting your best foot forward in the App Store, it's important to play by Apple's rules. Failure to follow recommended design patterns can increase development time, make it harder to be featured and lead to rejections during app submission.

Knowing Apple's guidelines like the back of our hands helps us create products consistent with the look and feel your users will expect. Intuitive design makes for happy customers and what's intuitive differs by interaction paradigm from platform to platform.

## 🙏 Deference
###### *noun;* Respectful or courteous regard

User patience is measured by the millisecond. Delivering fast, responsive and delightful tools is essential to standing out in a crowded market. Users may only launch your app once so it is essential to leave them satisfied from the very first screen.

###### We are relentlessly attentive to detail

When the job is done well, it is barely noticeable because the app exemplifies deference. The app stays out of the user's way and demonstrates a humble respect for their needs.

## 🛣 An Agile roadmap around your business objectives

When you submit a Request For Proposal to us, we will prepare a development plan for you grouped in 2 week sprints, sorted around your key objectives.
