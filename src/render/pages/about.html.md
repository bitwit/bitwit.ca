My name is Kyle and I’m a Web and iOS Developer. Currently, I live and work in Toronto, Canada as Lead Developer for [SIDEKICK](https://sidekick.pro). I have a passion for UX and am constantly trying to be a better designer as well. If you’d like to know more about some of my past and current work, check out my portfolio page.
